INTRO
-----

This bundle represents the GMP server and it describe the set of bundles that compose the application as well as the
configurations for them. From here one can build a locally running application or deploy a zip file or assembly in maven
paralance.

NOTE: All the instructions assume that your bundles sit in a GMP_SRC_DIR

The list of bundles is contained in its pom the list of GMP bundles that compose it for example GIAPI, etc..
Those are listed as dependencies in the current GMP_SRC_DIR/gmp-server/pom.xml

Besides it contains a pointer to the provision pom that contains a list of the dependencies as maven bundles, check
GMP_SRC_DIR/provision/pom.xml

Besides the configuration is included in the GMP_SRC_DIR/gmp-server/src/main/etc/conf/services if the bundles are using the ConfigAdmin service

ADDING APP BUNDLES
------------------
If you need to add an extra bundle to the application you can put it in the local pom as a regular maven dependency and
then deploy the pom via a:

   cd GMP_SRC_DIR/gmp-server
   mvn install
for the local repository, or:

   cd GMP_SRC_DIR/gmp-server
   mvn deploy
for the global repository

ADDING EXTERNAL BUNDLES
-----------------------
If you need to add an extra external bundle like OSGi services, third party bundles, or in general any bundle that is
not used at compile time by other bundles should be added to the provision file at giapi-osgi/provision/pom.xml
and then then deploy the pom via a:

   cd GMP_SRC_DIR/provision
   mvn install
for the local repository, or:

   cd GMP_SRC_DIR/provision
   mvn deploy
for the global repository

RUN LOCALLY
-----------
To run the application locally you need to install pax-runner and set it so that pax-run.sh/pax-run.bat is available
in your PATH. You can get pax-runner at
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ops4j/pax/runner/pax-runner-assembly/1.5.0/pax-runner-assembly-1.5.0-jdk15.tar.gz

Untar the file and add the pax-runner-1.5.0/bin to the global PATH

then you can run it using the included startgmp.sh script

Then felix is downloaded and installed into the runner directory and the bundles obtained from the local repository
After completed all the bundles are running locally and some extra services are included like ConfigAdmin, LogService
and the WebConsole

The WebConsole can be found at http://localhost:8888/admin

The script is set to keep the links between the bundles and the mvn repository so you can update your bundles with
maven using:
   mvn install

And then in the felix console do an update via
   update [bundleid]

STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT
---------------------
To build a tar ball with the application so that it can be deployed remotely without access to maven you should do

    mvn assembly:assembly
