/*! \page validation Integration Tests
 *
 * \section validation_intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is work in progress as we continue building the OCS infrastructure connection to the GMP.
 *
 * This page has information on the integration tests of the GMP. These tests are designed to check that
 * everything is working correctly from end to end. Currently, you can check updating status values from the C++ glue, and propagating
 * said changes to EPICS. This will show that JMS communication from the C++ glue to the GMP is working, as well as
 * the exposing of those values to EPICS channels.
 *
 * \subsection validation_testing_sec Testing Procedure
 * \li Start the GMP as indicated in \ref user_manual.
 * \li To check that everything is running correctly, you can run <tt>caget gpi:status1</tt> and see if it can read a
 * value. Remember to set the \c EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variable to point to the IP where the GMP is running.
 * \li Run <tt>camonitor gpi:status1 gpi:status2</tt> to connect clients to some EPICS channels.
 * Remember to set the \c EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variable to point to the IP where the GMP is running.
 * \li Run <tt>sh runExample.sh status</tt> (available in src/examples/ in the C++ glue code). Remember to either have a \c gmp.properties file configured in the
 * current directory, or to set the environment variable \c GMP_CONFIGURATION to point to the correct file.
 * \li Check that the camonitor reflects the changes in the values of the EPICS channels.
 * \li Run <tt>java -jar giapi-tester/target/giapi-tester-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -set gpi:status1 -value 100 -type INTEGER</tt>.
 * \li Check that the camonitor reflects the changes in the values of the EPICS channel.
 * \li Finally, run all the other tests in the C++ glue examples directory, except for the stresstest. For info on how
 * to run the stresstest check \ref performance.
