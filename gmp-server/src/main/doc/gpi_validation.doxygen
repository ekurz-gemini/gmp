\subsection gpi_test GPI Commands Test
A test script is made available to test all the apply commands. The script is available in the
GMP Server distribution file under \b bin/gpiTestAllCommands.sh

\attention This test should be used with care if not in simulation mode

\subsection gpi_test_setup Setup

To run the scripts you need the following

 - GMP Server running using the \b bin/start.sh script
 - TLC running using <b> $TLC_ROOT/startup/gpi-initd start</b>
 - TLC Command Event running with, e.g. <b>./bin/linux64/gpCmdEvent -c $TLC_ROOT/config/CONFIG.CmdEvent -simGmb -simTcs -d 1 </b> 

When they are all running, the script \b gpiTestAllCommands.sh can be called and it will try to execute all the known commands
in the right order and it will emit an ERROR message if needed

For example:
