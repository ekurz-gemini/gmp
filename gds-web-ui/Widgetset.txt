Vaadin can incorporate plugins or widgetset

Sometimes, for example when the version of one of them has changed, or Vaadin itselfs gets an upgrade, the widgetsets need a recompilation

The maven projects has the logic to do so but it has to be done manually

Follow the following steps:
mvn vaadin:update-widgetset
mvn gwt:compile
