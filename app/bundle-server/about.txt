To bootstrap:

0. I find that it's easiest to set up an alias for launcher that points to your
   dev tree:
   
        alias launcher='java -jar ~/Projects/osgi/runtime/launcher/launcher.jar'

1. Fetch it from another machine and give it an alias.

        launcher -h:manjar -i:bundle-server -a:temp
	
2. Set the bundle property to point to your local repository (dev) root, and
   then start up the app.

        launcher -a:temp -b:edu.gemini.util.obr.root=/Users/rnorris/Projects/osgi
        launcher -a:temp
        
   If you type ps -l you will see that everything is running but it's pointed
   to the other machine.
        
3. In another window, install the app again, this time from your own running
   server. You also need to set the root property.
   
        launcher -i:bundle-server
        launcher -a:bundle-server -b:edu.gemini.util.obr.root=/Users/rnorris/Projects/osgi

   Start up the server so it will download all its bundles. You will get a bind
   exception because the port is already bound in the other instance. This is ok.
   
        launcher -a:bundle-server
        ... Http2: org.mortbay.util.MultiException[java.net.BindException: Address already in use]
		
4. Shut down both servers now, by typing "shutdown" at both -> prompts.

5. Uninstall the temp version, and start up the new one.

		launcher -a:temp -u
		launcher -a:bundle-server
		
6. If you do a ps -l you will see that it's pointed at itself now. Note that
   this means you can't update the OBR Service itself. If this is going to be
   a problem, you can fix this by pointing it at the filesystem location rather 
   than the HTTP location, then turning auto-start down to level 3.
   
   		-> uninstall <number for OBR Service>
   		-> install file:/Users/rnorris/Projects/osgi/bundle/util/obr-server/obr-server.jar
   		-> start <number for new OBR Service>
   		-> shutdown
   		
   	    launcher -a:bundle-server -L:3
   	    launcher -a:bundle-server
   	    
   If you do ps -l now, everything should look correct. 

7. You should now be able to hit your dev repository from any instance of Oscar
   as follows:
   
        -> obr urls http://localhost:9999/bundle
        -> obr list
